------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most important question before discussing anything is that if publishing a data paper will prevent us from publishing future analysis based on the data or not. This page lists publishers that do not have any problem with the data being published earlier:

It is quite a large list so I think we can have the dataset published.

General considerations
----------------------

### Article name

Suggestions for the name of the article:
1. "Kinematics and kinetics of normal and perturbed walking on the treadmill: a comprehensive gait dataset" or variants of this
2.
3.

### Where to publish

#### Peer-reviewed (data journals)

Some major data journals:

-   Scientific Data
    -   Publisher: Nature
    -   Fee: $1350
    -   Data hosting: Up to 100 GB free at figshare
    -   Link: <https://www.nature.com/sdata/publish/submission-guidelines>
-   GigaScience Data Notes
    -   Publisher: Oxford Academic
    -   Fee: $1015
    -   Data hosting: Up to 1 TB free at their GigaDB repository
    -   Link: <https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/pages/data_note>
-   Data in Brief
    -   Publisher: Elsevier
    -   Fee: $500
    -   Data hosting: Not available
    -   Link: <https://www.elsevier.com/journals/data-in-brief/2352-3409/guide-for-authors>

#### Peer-reviewed (general)

There are journals that are not specifically targeted towards publishing data papers but they will accept data papers as well (e.g. PeerJ). However, these journals are open access too and they charge similar publication fees as data journals mentioned above.

#### Non peer-reviewed

Alternatively one can publish their article on many repositories available online and host the data in a separate repository. The advantage is that this will be free but the authors don't get any feedback on their methods and data practices.
Some of the famous online repositories for publication:

-   <https://arxiv.org/>
-   <https://www.biorxiv.org/>
-   <https://osf.io/preprints/>
-   <https://peerj.com/preprints-search/>
-   <https://f1000research.com/>

### Funding options

UMD funds 50% of the cost for open access publishing (<https://www.lib.umd.edu/oa/openaccessfund>). I don't know if a similar thing is available at CSU or not.
